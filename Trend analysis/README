Project: Trend analysis
Dataset: Housing - Trend analysis

- I have started the project by exploring the dataset and found the month when highest and lowest amount of houses being built.
- A histogram was created to show the distribution but since a time series is in question we need to create a line chart to get a better understanding. 
- A line chart with monthly data showed too many variation so I have reduced the time intervals to quarter by resampling it in Pivot table. 
- An uptrend was noticed for the Q2 and Q3 over the years and this seasonality was demonstrated with a stacked column pivot chart. 
- I have used a linear trendline but due the variation we have for seasonality it is better to use Forecast sheet feature for a better prediction.
